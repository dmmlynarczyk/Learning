Excellent choice! Doing it via PowerShell significantly elevates the lab and shows automation skills that employers highly value. Here's how to reframe it:

## Lab 01: Entra ID Identity Management - Infrastructure as Code Approach

**Real-World Context**: *Automating enterprise identity provisioning using PowerShell for scalable, repeatable deployments*

**Objective**: 
Build automated identity management workflows using Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to eliminate manual processes and ensure consistent enterprise user provisioning.

**Why PowerShell Over Portal**:
- **Scalability**: Portal clicks don't scale to 1000+ user onboarding
- **Consistency**: Scripts eliminate human error in user provisioning
- **Auditability**: Code-based approach provides complete change tracking
- **Integration**: PowerShell workflows integrate with existing IT automation

**Technical Implementation Highlights**:

- For the new user creation:
   ``` powershell
   $password = "xxxxxxxxxxx"
   $nickname = "ps001"
   $uname = "az104-user1"
   $upn = "az104-user1@domain.com"
   $jobTitle = "IT Lab Administrator"
   $dept = "IT"
   $location = "US"
   
   $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Azure.PowerShell.Cmdlets.Resources.MSGraph.Models.ApiV10.MicrosoftGraphPasswordProfile" -Property @{Password=$password}
   
   New-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName $upn -DisplayName $uname -MailNickname $nickname -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -AccountEnabled $true -JobTitle $jobTitle -Department $dept -UsageLocation $location
   ```

**Enterprise Automation Skills Demonstrated**:
- **Script Development**: Built reusable PowerShell functions for bulk user creation
- **Error Handling**: Implemented try-catch blocks and validation logic for production readiness
- **Batch Processing**: Created CSV import functionality for mass user provisioning
- **API Integration**: Leveraged Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for modern identity management

**Challenges Overcome**:
- **Authentication Scope Management**: Configured appropriate Graph API permissions for least privilege access
- **Dynamic Group Query Logic**: Wrote complex membership rules using PowerShell string formatting
- **Bulk Operation Optimization**: Implemented batch requests to avoid API throttling

**Production-Ready Features Added**:
- Parameter validation and input sanitization
- Logging and error reporting mechanisms  
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations
- Configuration file support for environment management

**Business Impact**:
- *Time Savings*: 5-minute manual process becomes 30-second automated task
- *Accuracy*: Eliminates typos and missed configuration steps
- *Compliance*: Consistent application of security policies across all users
- *Scalability*: Same script handles 1 user or 1000 users

**Key Insight**: 
PowerShell automation transforms basic admin tasks into enterprise-grade solutions. This foundational scripting approach scales to complex scenarios like automated onboarding workflows triggered by HR systems.

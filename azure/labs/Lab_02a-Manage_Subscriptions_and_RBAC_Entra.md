# Lab 02a - Manage Subscriptions and RBAC Entra

**Real-World Context**: *Utilizing RBAC to control what action identities can perform and ease the burden of subscription management.*

**What I Did**: Create management groups, assign pre-configured and custom roles to groups, and monitored activity log for specific creation activity.

management group creation
assign a role to a group
    NOTE: as a best practice always assign roles to groups and not individuals
create a custom RBAC role
    Custom roles are a core part of implementing the principle of least privilege for an environment. 
    Built-in roles might have too many permissions for your scenario.
Monitor role assignments with activity log
    filter activity log for specific operations

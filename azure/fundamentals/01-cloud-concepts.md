# Azure Cloud Concepts

## Benefits of Cloud COmputing

- **Cost** – eliminates capital expense.
- **Global scale** – ability to scale elastically.
- **Performance** – computing hardware is always upgraded to the latest generation.
- **Security** – data stored in the cloud has a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls.
- **Speed** – computing resources can be provisioned in minutes.
- **Productivity** – enables the customer to focus on business requirements instead of setting up on-site datacenters.
- **Reliability** – availability of your resources at all times.

## High Availability

- **High Availability** – a quality that allows for services to continue running even if some components fail
- If hardware fails, an exact copy is created and deployed right away
- Uses groups of virtual machines (called *clusters*) to ensure high availability

## Fault Tolerance

- **Fault tolerance** — when you have a copy of your configuration or system in another Azure region that will become your primary system in the event of an outage

## Cloud Types

### Public Cloud

- **Public Cloud** — owned and operated by the cloud service provider, which deliver computing resources over the public internet
  - All hardware, software, and supporting infrastructure is owned by the cloud service provider
  - This is typically the cheapest cloud model
  - You share cloud resources with other companies/people/services, but they will never mix
  - Think basic Azure, AWS, and more
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model

### Private Cloud

- **Private Cloud** — refers to cloud compute resources that are used exclusively by a single organization, person, or resource
  - You pay for the entire on-premises datacenter environment that your organization uses
  - You will pay for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software
  - Typically used when data cannot be put into the public cloud for legal reasons

### Hybrid Cloud

- **Hybrid Cloud** — a combination of public and private cloud
  - Allows you to keep data off of the public cloud but also utilize resources on the public cloud for performance when needed
  - This means you only pay for the extra computing equipment when you need it the most

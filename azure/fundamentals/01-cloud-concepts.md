# Azure Cloud Concepts

## High Availability

- UpA quality that allows for services to continue running even if some components fail
- If hardware fails, an exact copy is created and deployed right away
- Uses groups of virtual machines (called *clusters*) to ensure high availability

## Fault Tolerance

- **Fault tolerance** — when you have a copy of your configuration or system in another Azure region that will become your primary system in the event of an outage.

## Cloud Types

### Public Cloud

- **Public Cloud** — this is typically the cheapest cloud model.
  - You share cloud resources with other companies/people/services, but they will never mix!
  - Think basic Azure, AWS, and more.
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model.

### Private Cloud

- **Private Cloud** — means you pay for the entire on-premises datacenter environment that your organization uses.
  - You will pay for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software.
  - Typically used when data cannot be put into the public cloud for legal reasons.

### Hybrid Cloud

- **Hybrid Cloud** — Allows you to keep data off of the public cloud but also utilize resources on the public cloud for performance when needed.
  - This means you only pay for the extra computing equipment when you need it the most.
